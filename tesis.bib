abstract = "To search for the existence of any correlation among different objects or observations is a natural human tendency. The notion of quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling was evolved from the idea of possible existence of a mathematical correlation between the nature of chemicals and their behavioral manifestation. Following the initial observations, the “chemical nature” was conceptualized and explored in terms of information extractable from the structure and property of chemicals. Properties elicited by chemicals are significantly influenced by the nature of their chemical structure (branching, functional groups, electronegative behavior, stereochemical features, etc.), as well as different physicochemical properties (hydrophobicity, electronic nature, steric influence, etc.). The development of suitable descriptors (predictor variables) possessing a potential diagnostic nature in extracting the chemical attributes can help in exploring the mechanistic basis involved in a chemical–biological process following mathematical model development. Thus, QSAR studies allow a rational explanation for the behavioral manifestation of chemicals accompanied with providing knowledge on the mechanism involved, thereby creating an opportunity to tune the behavior of a chemical. As it provides a good alternative method to laboratory experimentation, at least for initial screening, QSAR is utilized in costly research like the design of drug molecules and assessment of chemical hazards. This chapter provides an account of the background, history, basic components, and application of QSAR techniques."

This chapter discusses covalent and Coulomb interactions as the strong forces operating within molecules. Covalent forces tightly bind the atoms together within the molecule. They are of short range, that is, they operate over very short distances of the order of interatomic separations. Covalently bonded atoms make up molecules and crystals with well-defined structures that cannot normally melt or liquify without totally breaking the bonds. They tend to sublimate, decompose, or undergo a chemical reaction above some temperature rather than going through the conventional solid-liquid-gas states that are characteristic of physically bonded molecules. This chapter starts with a discussion on covalent or chemical bonding forces, and the differences between physical and chemical bonds. The chapter then explains Coulomb forces (charge–charge interactions). Concepts of ionic crystals and reference states are explained. The chapter gives detailed discussion on the Born energy as well as solubility of ions in different solvents. The chapter concludes with presenting computer simulations and integral equations of many-body systems."

Realization of reliable bonding is the immutable requirement for adhesives. The interfacial adhesive strength is basically determined by the intermolecular interactions at interfaces, such as van der Waals and hydrogen bonds. When coupling agents are utilized for improving interfacial adhesion, it is essential to consider the chemistry of the adhesive molecules and the functional groups of the coupling agents. In addition to the intermolecular interactions, mechanical factors in meso-scale of adhesive layers can also contribute to the bonding strength of adhesive joints. In this chapter, the theoretical background for structural integrity of adhesive joints in microelectronics is discussed."

abstract={THE synthesis of molecular carbon structures in the form of C60 and other fullerenes1 has stimulated intense interest in the structures accessible to graphitic carbon sheets. Here I report the preparation of a new type of finite carbon structure consisting of needle-like tubes. Produced using an arc-discharge evaporation method similar to that used for fullerene synthesis, the needles grow at the negative end of the electrode used for the arc discharge. Electron microscopy reveals that each needle comprises coaxial tubes of graphitic sheets, ranging in number from 2 up to about 50. On each tube the  carbon-atom hexagons are arranged in a helical fashion about the needle axis. The helical pitch varies from needle to needle and from tube to tube  within a single needle. It appears that this helical structure may aid the growth process. The formation of these needles, ranging from a few to a few tens of nanometres in diameter, suggests that engineering of carbon structures should be possible on scales considerably greater than those relevant to the fullerenes.},

abstract  ="The use of electronically sorted (i.e. semiconducting or metallic) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) for the removal of organic compounds from aqueous environments is investigated. Chromatography techniques are used to separate the semiconducting type from the metallic type. Spectroscopy (including UV-visible) is employed to measure the uptake of 1-pyrenebutyric acid{,} diquat dibromide{,} and 2{,}4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid onto the sorted SWCNTs. Kinetic and equilibrium analysis show that the semiconducting type is capable of adsorbing up to 70.6% more adsorbate compared to the metallic type. This is likely attributed to the favorability of these compounds interacting with the semiconducting type due to a lack of electron density around this type of SWCNT. Moreover{,} a comparison of the material separated in-house by chromatography to those purchased from a commercial source shows that the in-house material is capable of adsorbing 26.5 to 60% more adsorbate versus the commercial material in which the SWCNTs were separated using density gradient ultracentrifugation methods. This demonstrates that chromatography techniques potentially yield a more effective separation of the semiconducting and metallic SWCNTs. Such opportunities can be influential in the development of new adsorbent systems towards removal of targeted compounds from aqueous environments."}

abstract = {ABSTRACT Fungi were isolated from soil samples corresponding to pesticide-contaminated soil (CS) and noncontaminated soil (NCS) in the Annaba vicinity (Algeria) and identified. The number of isolates obtained from CS and NCS were 263 and 288, respectively. The most frequent species (Aspergillus fumigatus, A. niger, A. terreus, Absidia corymbifera, and Rhizopus microsporus var microsporus) were not sensitive to the pesticides. The growth of the genus Trichoderma was inhibited by the pesticides, while genera Absidia and Fusarium were stimulated. The 53 species isolated were assayed for their ability to remove metribuzin from liquid medium. Only Botrytis cinerea from NCS and Sordaria superba and Absidia fusca from CS removed more than 50\% of the compound after 5 d. Metamitron was very resistant. Among the 21 species tested, only Alternaria solani (from NCS), Drechslera australiensis (from CS and NCS), and Absidia fusca (from CS) reduced the concentration in the medium more than 10\% (10–16\%). Twelve species were grown with linuron, seven of them were inefficient in removing this compound. The two strains of Sordaria macrospora yielded 22 to 25\% depletion, while Botrytis cinerea depleted linuron almost completely. Among the 31 species assayed for their ability to eliminate metobromuron, Botrytis cinerea (from CS and NCS) depleted almost completely the chemical from the medium. Rhizopus oryzae and Absidia fusca from CS removed 40 and 47\% of the compound, respectively. No systematic relationships were observed between the soil contamination and herbicide elimination capacities of soil fungi. Absidia fusca and Botrytis cinerea were particularly interesting for bioremediation purposes because they were able to transform efficiently three of the four compounds assayed.},

In particular, carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNFET)-based digital circuits promise substantial energy-efficiency benefits, but the inability to perfectly control intrinsic nanoscale defects and variability in carbon nanotubes has precluded the realization of very-large-scale?integrated systems. Here we overcome these challenges to demonstrate a beyond-silicon microprocessor built entirely from CNFETs. This 16-bit microprocessor is based on the RISC-V instruction set, runs standard 32-bit instructions on 16-bit data and addresses, comprises more than 14,000 complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor CNFETs and is designed and fabricated using industry-standard design flows and processes. We propose a manufacturing methodology for carbon nanotubes, a set of combined processing and design techniques for overcoming nanoscale imperfections?at macroscopic scales across full wafer substrates.

This paper critically reviews the recent progress on the synthesis and applications of carbon nanotube (CNT) based membranes in water treatment. Various synthesis techniques for the preparation of CNT based membranes are discussed. Furthermore, the effect of incorporating CNTs in the matrix on the membrane properties has deliberated in detail. The key issues associated with the synthesis of CNT based membranes for actual applications are highlighted. Finally, research directions are given to ensure the fabrication and application of CNT membranes in a more effective manner. This paper may provide an insight for the development of CNT based membranes for water purification in future. With their tremendous separation performance, low biofouling potential and ultra-high water flux, CNT membranes have the potential to be a leading technology in water treatment, especially desalination."
