abstract = "Abstract:
Realization of reliable bonding is the immutable requirement for adhesives. The interfacial adhesive strength is basically determined by the intermolecular interactions at interfaces, such as van der Waals and hydrogen bonds. When coupling agents are utilized for improving interfacial adhesion, it is essential to consider the chemistry of the adhesive molecules and the functional groups of the coupling agents. In addition to the intermolecular interactions, mechanical factors in meso-scale of adhesive layers can also contribute to the bonding strength of adhesive joints. In this chapter, the theoretical background for structural integrity of adhesive joints in microelectronics is discussed."

title={Helical microtubules of graphitic carbon},
journal={Nature},
year={1991},
volume={354},
number={6348},
pages={56-58},
abstract={THE synthesis of molecular carbon structures in the form of C60 and other fullerenes1 has stimulated intense interest in the structures accessible to graphitic carbon sheets. Here I report the preparation of a new type of finite carbon structure consisting of needle-like tubes. Produced using an arc-discharge evaporation method similar to that used for fullerene synthesis, the needles grow at the negative end of the electrode used for the arc discharge. Electron microscopy reveals that each needle comprises coaxial tubes of graphitic sheets, ranging in number from 2 up to about 50. On each tube the  carbon-atom hexagons are arranged in a helical fashion about the needle axis. The helical pitch varies from needle to needle and from tube to tube  within a single needle. It appears that this helical structure may aid the growth process. The formation of these needles, ranging from a few to a few tens of nanometres in diameter, suggests that engineering of carbon structures should be possible on scales considerably greater than those relevant to the fullerenes.},
